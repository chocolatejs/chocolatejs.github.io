#### A place to celebrate the usually uninvited faces in tech.

Imagine the genius with the lightbulb moment that was never given the platform to shine. 
Too often, the common genius is undermined by people who cannot understand the beauty in difference. 
I believe people are shortsighted and narrow minded when it comes to accepting the first outlier in their
dataset. Even scientific researchers say, "we can just disregard that variable, it's an outlier." 

Outliers matter. For they are the beginning of a new path, a new skew, in our realities. 

**But what's the reality of today?**

We're falling deeper into the cusp where the perceived value of sameness is greater than the perceived
value of equality. That's the reality, unfortunately. 

You're more concerned with where I've graduated from school than what I've learned or what I've done.
You're still concerned with "thinking outside the box" rather than realizing that boxes were designed
for shipping, not thinking.
You're unfortunately still asking what framework I'm using to solve a problem rather than asking about the
problem I'm solving.
Still asking what language is this program written in rather than understanding the message we've 
been preaching in the same language that you speak.

Some mask our beauty by calling us diversity hires. Some lessen the support of our allies by considering
what they do, charity work.

**How will we celebrate?**

We will create a safe space for the outliers to align and build the future. Unskewed by the ignorance
of a rigamortis status quo. We will show the depth of this collective we call ChocolateJS.

**What's next?**

Think of that next big idea, how it should be built, and build it here. We'll [give you free private repositories](https://twitter.com/chocolatejs/status/756539943019614208) and help you figure out the right license to choose. After that, we'll show you how to [open source the project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). You would be surprised to know the resources we have available.
